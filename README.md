# My Approach
- Creating mental model to solve this problem, started with breaking UI in components.
- Intial Setup for installing required libraries.
- Breaking main page into 4 components navbar,hero,blog and footer.
- implement fetch all blogs feature first with basic UI.
- proceed with get blog by id feature and understand react query well by reading docs.
- create blog functionality feature implementation.
- UI enhancement and responsiveness check.
- testing whole implementation and bug fixes.



# Scope For Future Improvments
- Edit and Delete Blog feature.
- make custom backend for blogs.
- authentication and authorization login/signup.
- adding more fields in blog like author,referencences,sharing options etc.
